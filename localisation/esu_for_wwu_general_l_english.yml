 mf_positive_personality.EVTOPTC1: "Let him drill our soldiers."
 mf_positive_personality.EVTNAME2: "Banquet for a Neighbor"
 mf_positive_personality.EVTDESC2: "During one of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s usual extravagant parties, a certain [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName] of the neighboring nation of [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.TAG.GetName] was also invited to the banquet. Fortunately for us, the gold that would be typically wasted in such a banquet as this was put to good use, as [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName] was very pleased with our lavish display and high quality of food, and the [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] is sure to attend our banquets again in the future... should our relations remain friendly, of course." 
 mf_positive_personality.EVTOPTA2: "Tell [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName] [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetSheHe] is welcome here."
 
 #Negative personalities
 mf_negative_personality.EVTNAME1: "Suspected Bastard?"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTDESC1: "Rumors around the court say that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s consort has been unfaithful to him. These rumors are damaging enough to our reputation, but the situation has gotten worse now that a child has been born with questionable origins. Although it is not certain that he is a bastard child, the rumors of our consort have already convinced many that it is so... and, unfortunately, some evidence does indeed line up in support of this rumour. All we can do now is accept the child as our heir or deny him the right of succession."   
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTA1: "Tis only court gossip..."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTB1: "No bastard shall be an heir of mine!"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTC1: "We can allay their suspicions."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTNAME2: "An Inferior Castle"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTDESC2: "Word has reached [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ears regarding our rival's grand castle. Our diplomats report that their castle's impressive size and beauty impress all ambassadors who arrive at its gates. While this has little to do with the actual defenses of the castle, it seems that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has become greatly irritated from this news; in fact, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has already begun drafting a new castle."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTA2: "This cannot stand!"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTB2: "A few additions shouldn't hurt..."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTC2: "Trivial things must be ignored."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTNAME3: "A Lax Military"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTDESC3: "The kind and easygoing nature of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has caused our armies to become soft and lax, and even some of our finest generals are falling into the trap of luxury and indulgence. While this sort of easygoing personality is what allows our soldiers to be fully content and completely loyal to our state, it will bring great harm to our military power and efficiency in battle. Therefore, drastic measures must be taken to whip our armies back into shape."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTA3: "Something must be done!"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTB3: "It can't be helped..."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTC3: "Surely, we can do much more!"
