The Scourge will gain strength overtaking the human and elf kingdoms in the area. Only a large and powerful undead force will be able to assault Dalaran so that Archimonde, Overlord of the Legion and brother to Kil'Jaeden, may be summoned to Azeroth Himself. Once summoned, Archimonde will head towards Mount Hyjal to destroy Nordrassil and set fire to Azeroth.
