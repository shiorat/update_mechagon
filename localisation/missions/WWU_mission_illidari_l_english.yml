 wwu_mission_illidari.1.title: "Illidan Assaults the Frozen Throne"
 wwu_mission_illidari.1.desc: "Having thought to build a power base for himself in Outland, Illidan was instead discovered by Kil'Jaeden and held accountable for his failure with the Eye of Sargeras. Furious at Illidan and still desiring the destruction of the Lich King, Kil'Jaeden made Illidan swear to descend upon Icecrown himself and destroy the Frozen Throne once and for all. The only acceptable outcome for Illidan is the defeat of Ner'Zhul, His champion Arthas, and the destruction of the Helm of Domination itself. Despairing at this attack, Ner'Zhul has personally demanded His champion Arthas to return to Northrend and rescue the Scourge from the Legion's fate. The undead Nerubian lord Anub'Arak has emerged from Azjol-Nerub to personally escort Arthas through the secret passages of the Nerubians up to the base of Icecrown Citadel. The young Death Knight's powers will be restored to their full strength, removing the effects the Eye of Sargeras had upon him."
