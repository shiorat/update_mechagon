 wwu_king_of_kobolds_G28_desc: "If we are to truly become a Kingdom of Kobolds then we must first assert ourselves in a dominant position in our home of the Stonetalon Mountains, in securing this position we will also be able to prepare for Togwaggles greatest dream, to not just be the King of Windshear but to be the King of every Kobold on Azeroth.

 wwu_force_the_centaur_G28_desc:  "Ever since we began to leave our caves more often we have found ourself often under threath by the half humanoid Centaur who kill our scouting parties and at times have even dared to try and strike into our caves! This simply can not do and these abominations must be dealt with. While the Centaur are used to raiding others a large scale attack on the Stonetalon Centaurs should throw them into disaray and give us a more defendable position"
 
 wwu_plunder_the_land_G28_title: "Colonize the land"
 wwu_plunder_the_land_G28_desc: "While we officially control the former Centaur land due to their nomadic nature we havent truly driven them out and many still persist and refuse to acknowledge our rule over them.

 wwu_outposts_in_the_barrens_G28_desc: "In our quest to secure our border we have come across an untamed and vast land known as the Barrens. The land is for the most part useless, difficult to grow anything on and sparse in resources.

 wwu_treasure_hoard_of_the_west_G28_desc: "The new fortifications in the west has inspired many Kobolds to connect tunnels over to the fortifications which has inspired our leadership to build new treasure hoards in the fortifications.

 wwu_construct_farms_G28_title: "Construct farms"
 wwu_construct_farms_G28_desc: "If we are to begin expansion our most important task will be to feed our soldiers.

Few times our stragedies are nothing more than trying overwhelm our opponent in the small tunnels we call our homes. If we wish to expand to the outside world a more effective type of leadership for our armies will be neceassery. While there are very few Kobolds who could make for good generals anything we can get would be better than nothing"

 wwu_push_the_border_west_G28_desc: "Now with our western border secured our scouts have been more brave when scouting out the land west to our nation. There we have discovered the massive Tauren people which the sight of set pure fear into the scouts.

 wwu_treasure_fleet_G28_title: "Treasure fleet"
 wwu_treasure_fleet_G28_desc: "None would have ever thought it but now we rule the waves! No more shall the Kobolds be laughed at as nothing more than a cave dwelling gold obsessed pest.

 wwu_fortify_the_northern_front_G28_desc: "To our north do we not just have an powerful enemy but one of the most powerful people of all of Azeroth. The night elves are ancient and known powers that we can not even begin to imagine.

 wwu_construct_arsenal_G28_title: "Construct arsenals"
 wwu_construct_arsenal_G28_desc: "If we are to effectively defend ourselves from the night elves our army must be well equiped to face them in battle.

 wwu_build_up_our_forces_G28_desc: "Now that we are in no short supply of weapons the next step will be to train profesional soldiers to use the weapons.

 wwu_force_the_furbolgs_into_submission_G28_desc: "The Furbolgs are a long standing ally of the night elves and while they have been officially neutral in our conflict with the elves it is a secret to no one to whom they are alligned with. Seeing as we have been continusly victorious against the night elves they are likely to try and seek help from the Furbolgs to reclaim their lost land.

 wwu_kick_the_night_elves_out_G28_desc: "For ages the night elves have been the dominant power in Kalimdor but no more!
