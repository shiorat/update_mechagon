 wwu_thrall.1.title: "Discovery of Go'el"
 wwu_thrall.1.desc: "Son of Durotan and Draka, Go'el was born with green skin. This was seen as evidence that Gul'dan had damned the orcs for all generations. No longer willing to stand by, Durotan and Draka looked to rid the Horde of the dark forces controlling it. Telling the clan to remain in Alterac Valley, they both travelled south to reveal the truth to the Horde.\n\nDrek'Thar used his shamanistic powers to contact Durotan's old friend, Orgrim Doomhammer. Arranging a meeting in Loch Modan, Orgrim agreed to meet, he himself beginning to distrust fel magic. Upon their meeting, Durotan told Orgrim of the corruption afflicting the Horde. In turn, Orgrim told of the corruption of the Black Morass and the dead lands left behind. \n\nUrging them to take shelter, Orgrim assigned his guards to accompany them home. However, the guards were secretly loyal to the Shadow Council, and with orders from Gul'dan, killed both Durotan and Draka on the journey back. Go'el was spared, left to die in the cold. However, as chance would have it, Aedelas Blackmoore discovered the grisly scene, and decided to take Go'el back to Durnholde Keep."

 wwu_thrall.2.title: "Thrall's Escape"
 wwu_thrall.2.desc: "Although saved by Blackmoore's grace, Go'el was raised a gladiator, and became known as 'Thrall' within Durnholde Keep. Subjugated to years of abuse at the hands of uncaring humans, Thrall one day escaped the fortress and sought to find the rest of his kind.\n\nThrall soon encountered the Warsong clan, whose chieftain, Grommash Hellscream left a deep impression upon the young orc. Seeking the truth of his own origin, he left the Warsong clan and travelled north, in search of the Frostwolf clan."

 wwu_thrall.3.title: "Thrall's Reunion"
 wwu_thrall.3.desc: "Having endured a treacherous journey through human lands, Thrall eventually reached the Alterac mountains, and within found the Frostwolves. Upon meeting Drek'Thar, Thrall learnt of the clan's exile and his lineage within the clan as the successor to his father Durotan. As Thrall adapted to Frostwolf culture, he began to take on the shamanistic practices taught by Drak'Thar, and soon became a powerful shaman worthy of acting as the chieftain of the Frostwolves."

 wwu_thrall.4.title: "Thrall's Journey"
 wwu_thrall.4.desc: "Having reunited with his brethren, Thrall looked to outside world and saw that many orcs remained suffering at the hands of the humans. Unable to ignore such thoughts, Thrall relinquished control of the Frostwolves to Drek'Thar and began a journey to free as many orcs as possible, and to establish a new Horde based on co-operation, not conquest."
