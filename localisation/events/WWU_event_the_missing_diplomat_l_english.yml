SI:7 agents quickly arrested them and returned to Stormwind for interrogation, while others stayed for awhile and gathered evidence.\n\nWhat we discovered was quite interesting, though it is hard to deduce a meaning from them. According to eyewitnesses report, our king was indeed there. A black dragon with few other drakes arrived to the Island, seemingly in cahoots with local leader of Defias. They claim this black dragon started a dark ritual on our monarch but then the Naga arrived and everything went into chaos.\n\nFrom then on, the reports get contradictory.
