This often includes making common cause with foreign powers. Recently, several key figures appear to have struck an agreement with [neighbour_country.GetUsableName] to advocate a pro-[neighbour_country.GetAdjective] course of action in return for certain favors and promises. While not directly treasonable, this behavior is clearly detrimental to our interests; however, reining them in is likely to prove no easy matter."
 wwu_random_events.25.option.a: "They will pay for their treachery."
 wwu_random_events.25.option.b: "We'll deal with them later."
 wwu_random_events.25.option.c: "Let [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Intimidate them."
 
 wwu_random_events.26.title: "Assassination of Noble"
 wwu_random_events.26.desc: "The noble families are the bulwark of our power. However, they are not a united force and are locked in a constant struggle against each other for influence and power. As time marches on, some noble houses might see their fortunes rise while others could lose all their power, the resulting envy leading to bitter rivalries and recriminiations. Recently, one of these rivalries boiled over into outright conflict as [Root.assassinated_dude.GetName], the leader of a powerful noble house, was assassinated by his rivals. Furious, his surviving relatives are preparing their violent revenge..."

 wwu_random_events.28.title: "Monopoly Company Formed"
 wwu_random_events.28.desc: "The realm often grants trading companies the exclusive rights to traffic goods in a region in exchange for a lump-sum payment and continuing revenues from the traders.

 wwu_random_events.29.title: "Nobles Demand Increased Pensions"
 wwu_random_events.29.desc: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has to employ many methods to keep the unruly nobles in line. One of the most common is cold hard cash.

 wwu_random_events.30.title: "Grant Export Licenses"
 wwu_random_events.30.desc: "Instead of paying cash to the nobles, another option is to grant them privileges to collect special revenues, for example from foreign trade, from which they can make a healthy profit. A proposal has recently reached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s ears to grant several noble families export licenses for our trade with [neighbour_country.GetUsableName].

 wwu_random_events.33.title: "Cities Demand Old Rights"
 wwu_random_events.33.desc: "As we look to centralize the state, we inevitably infringe on the autonomy of the urban dwellers, who have always existed under a different code of rules than their rural brethren.

 wwu_random_events.33.option.c: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will handle it."
 
 wwu_random_events.34.title: "Non-enforcement of Ordinances"
 wwu_random_events.34.desc: "Although the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] issues many ordinances, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is in practice almost powerless to enforce them. Instead, enforcement depends upon the local powers - regional nobility and city governments - that are not always as vigilant as would be desired. Recently, it has come to our attention that our authorities in [troublesome_province.GetAreaName] are being particularly reticent in enforcing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s will."
 wwu_random_events.34.option.a: "Let them handle it."
 wwu_random_events.34.option.b: "Increase attempts!"
 wwu_random_events.34.option.c: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will handle it."
 
 wwu_random_events.35.title: "The [Root.GetTradersName] Request Privileges"
 wwu_random_events.35.desc: "The [Root.GetTradersName] have grown increasingly resentful of the power of the noble families and particularly their lack of opportunities in the higher ranks of government. Their only route into power is to marry into poor but well-titled noble families, or to pry open positions in government circles by demanding greater privileges from the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]."
 wwu_random_events.35.option.a: "Grant them privileges."
 wwu_random_events.35.option.b: "Deny them privileges."
 wwu_random_events.35.option.c: "Attempt to open up new opportunities without upsetting old elites."
 
 wwu_random_events.36.title: "Build a Great Palace"
 wwu_random_events.36.desc: "Monarchs often struggling to subdue the nobility and secure their standing in the eyes of their peers. The rise of firearms has reduced the nobles' role as warriors but left them with, in the eyes of the monarchs, too much idle time. In order to dazzle the nobles and keep them occupied, many monarchs are increasingly creating grand new palaces and introducing elaborate court rituals. [Root.GetUsableNameCap] is no different, and we have instructed our chief architect to draw up plans for a new palace to be built."
 wwu_random_events.36.option.a: "Build the palace."
 wwu_random_events.36.option.b: "Don't build it."

 wwu_random_events.37.desc: "The philosopher [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has not shied back from expressing opinions contrary to those of both the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] and the Holy Church. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHisCap] latest publications appear to have been particularly provocative, so much so that the Church is demanding we hand [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim] over to their inquisitors to be tried for heresy and 'persuaded' to recant. Denying the them this would anger the Church greatly, but [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has many supporters among the [Root.GetAdjective] intelligentsia."
 wwu_random_events.37.option.a: "Imprison $PHILOSOPHER_O_PRONOUN$."
 wwu_random_events.37.option.b: "Allow $PHILOSOPHER_O_PRONOUN$ to remain free."
 wwu_random_events.37.option.c: "[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap]'s got some interesting ideas actually!"
 
 wwu_random_events.38.title: "Merchants harassed"
 wwu_random_events.38.desc: "Our merchants have long complained about the unfair treatment they have suffered in [harassing_merchants_nation.GetUsableName]. Recently, however, these complaints have escalated and the merchants now claim to be victims of [harassing_merchants_nation.GetAdjective] brigandage and privateering - attacks they insist were carried out with the tacit support of the [harassing_merchants_nation.GetAdjective] [harassing_merchants_nation.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]. We must find a solution to the issue, one way or another."
 wwu_random_events.38.option.a: "Escalate complaint."

Agreeing to this would be popular with the peasantry but would be seen as an infringement on their authority by the [Root.GetNobilityName]."

 wwu_random_events.39.option.b: "Deny petition."
 
 wwu_random_events.40.title: "Noble Family Requests Aid"
 wwu_random_events.40.desc: "One of [Root.GetUsableName]'s most powerful noble families has, despite its vast landed wealth, managed to accumulate significant debts that it is finding hard to pay back. They have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to ask for help, hoping that their distant kinship with the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family and their promises of undying support will sway [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to help them out in their time of need."

 wwu_random_events.40.option.b: "Deny aid."
 
 wwu_random_events.41.title: "Support for Dissidents"

Although they are most likely lying, their claims have excited many influential people at our court. Supporting these dissidents probably won't accomplish anything other than antagonizing [dissidents_in_here.GetUsableName] but turning them down could give a bad impression."
 wwu_random_events.41.option.a: "Support."
 wwu_random_events.41.option.b: "Decline."
 
 wwu_random_events.42.title: "Foreign Trade Competition Rises"
 wwu_random_events.42.desc: "Foreign merchants are increasingly out-competing [Root.GetAdjective] traders in our ports, flooding our markets with cheap goods produced elsewhere.

 wwu_random_events.42.option.b: "There shall be no new tariffs."
