 wwu_exploration.100.title: "The First Circumnavigation"
 wwu_exploration.100.desc: "Our fleet set sail to find a sea route to Kalimdor. Ghastly winds took them far further north-west. The icy waters were treacherous and when they finally reached land once again, the captain wept with joy. Once it arrived at our port it became the first ship to circumnavigate Azeroth."
 wwu_exploration.100.option.a: "We are the first to circumnavigate Azeroth!"
 
 wwu_exploration.101.title: "Circumnavigation of Azeroth"
 wwu_exploration.101.desc: "We are not the first to have managed to circumnavigate Azeroth, but nevertheless it is a great feat and it will be celebrated throughout the land! "
 wwu_exploration.101.option.a: "A fabulous feat, even if we were not the first..."
 
 wwu_exploration.1.title: "Ordeal in $PROVINCENAME$"
 wwu_exploration.1.desc: "During our mission to find viable provinces to colonize, we stumbled upon $PROVINCENAME$. Its natives are mostly hostile, but the land is very prosperous. We would gain much from trading with this province. Although we might need to bribe a chief or two..."
 wwu_exploration.1.option.a: "Make them a fair deal."
 wwu_exploration.1.option.b: "Make them a dishonest deal."
 
 wwu_exploration.2.title: "$PROVINCENAME$ Troopers"
 wwu_exploration.2.desc: "Our expedition encountered hostile natives from $PROVINCENAME$ which led them to flee from the province. A few of the crew had disembarked to find fresh water and were returning to the ship when five native canoes with armed men appeared. The crew turned their boat around and raced back to the boat with the canoes just behind. One of the canoes nearly caught up with the boat, but as the men prepared for a fight the canoe slowed down as to wait for the others. The ship escaped, but some of the crew were wounded. A poisoned arrow hit one of the men in the leg, and although the wound was disinfected with urine and olive oil, we do not know if the man will survive."
 wwu_exploration.2.option.a: "See if some tawdry trinkets will placate the natives."
 wwu_exploration.2.option.b: "Get back there, kill the natives and take their gold!"
 
 wwu_exploration.4.title: "Glory Road"
 wwu_exploration.4.desc: "The lookout had reported signs of dwellings but the ship had yet to see any natives until at long last a coastal village in $PROVINCENAME$ was sighted. A small force disembarked and was hospitably received, something that was attributed to the natives' fascination with the men who were taller in stature than them and bearded. The natives were beardless and with some difficulty they managed to communicate that their myths and legends foretold of a time when their bearded gods would come from the sea to visit them. Food and gold were given, which indicates that the province is prosperous and would be of great value to us."
 wwu_exploration.4.option.a: "This is a promising land!"
 
 wwu_exploration.6.title: "Unwelcome Passenger"
 wwu_exploration.6.desc: "The village had been abandoned for some time, the failing crops spoke of a drought that must have plagued the province for quite some time. As we returned to our ship, we got a dreadful shock: one of the largest bears we've ever seen trying to climb aboard the ship! The seamen decided to capture the starved beast with the hope of bringing it back to our country, but the bear had other plans. It was leashed and brought aboard the ship, but the bear fought itself free of the ropes and we had to kill it. This attack and the devastated state $PROVINCENAME$ is in has made us realize that it is a lost cause."
 wwu_exploration.6.option.a: "A real shame."
 
 wwu_exploration.7.title: "The Green Hills of $PROVINCENAME$"
 wwu_exploration.7.desc: "The natives in $PROVINCENAME$ were enthralled by the glass beads, brass bells, and cloth our explorers traded for fresh fish and venison. In their report to us the ship's crew spoke about that there was very little wealth among the people and they seemed peaceful. Some events troubled them, as the villagers for some reason deserted their homes one night and left the village to be explored by the members of the expedition. Nothing much was found, only a small rattle made of gold buried among some fishing nets bore witness that this province might yield some fortune for us."
 wwu_exploration.7.option.a: "How great!"
 
 wwu_exploration.9.title: "The Menace from $PROVINCENAME$"
 wwu_exploration.9.desc: "After a rather turbulent beginning with the natives of $PROVINCENAME$ we finally managed to convince them of our good intentions. As we made landfall two men, one old and one young, approached our ship. They were not interested in our gifts and when a musket was fired over their heads to make them back away, it wounded the older man slightly. He ran to their huts and brought men who threw spears at our crew until they were chased off after two more rounds were fired. The adults fled into the woods, leaving their children behind. Some small trinkets and beads were left behind with the children as a gesture of friendship before the expedition members retreated to the ship."
 wwu_exploration.9.option.a: "Make them understand we meant them no harm."
 wwu_exploration.9.option.b: "If they return - kill them!"
 
 wwu_exploration.10.title: "The $PROVINCENAME$ Beasts"
 wwu_exploration.10.desc: "Before we went on the expedition, we had heard tales of an explorer by the name of Hanno who had found an island populated with a 'hirsute and savage people'. Hanno had made attempts to capture the males which failed, but three females were taken. Their ferocious nature forced the explorer to kill them and to bring proof of this savages, their skins were preserved for transport. These people were called 'gorillae' by the interpreters traveling with Hanno. We assume that the apelike specie we found in $PROVINCENAME$ must be these Gorillae Hanno spoke of."
 wwu_exploration.10.option.a: "They can be tamed with some baubles."
 wwu_exploration.10.option.b: "Grab what you can and get out!"
 
 wwu_exploration.11.title: "A Scattering of Poison"
 wwu_exploration.11.desc: "The expedition was closing in on $PROVINCENAME$ when a barrage of arrows, shot from the natives standing on the inviting beach, assailed the ship. In the hurry to race away from the enemy, who leapt with great whoops towards their canoes, the crew had to abandon some of the men who had been shot and tumbled overboard. When they had laid some sea miles between $PROVINCENAME$ and themselves, they discovered that the whole starboard side of the ship was covered in arrows.\nThe explorer on board the assailed ship was seriously wounded, the arrow that hit him had been poisoned. He lay in fever, sweating and swearing, for several days. Despite the surgeon's care and the disinfectant made of urine and olive oil, he died some time ago."
 wwu_exploration.11.option.a: "Such a horrible fate!"
 
 wwu_exploration.12.title: "Drunken Explorer"
 wwu_exploration.12.desc: "One of our expedition members - our explorer, of all people! - managed to get himself into a dreadfully embarrassing situation when he overestimated his own capability of handling the fruity liquor the natives of $PROVINCENAME$ brew. Disgusting details won't make it into this report, but he was sick as a pig for a long time. The natives thought it fun, laughing at his misery, but the rumors of this event has reached the ears of the high socialites who frown upon such behavior."
 wwu_exploration.12.option.a: "Fruity liquor? Did you bring some back?"
 
 wwu_exploration.14.title: "Unexpected Explorer"
 wwu_exploration.14.desc: "As the ship entered the bay of $PROVINCENAME$, a small crowd of natives had gathered on the beach and were silently regarding the expedition. The ship's mate jumped into a spontaneous and cheerful dance to the accompaniment of pipes. The natives started laughing which broke the tension. Food and drink was brought down to the beach for them all to feast upon. One of the natives showed great interest in the ship, the swords, and other pieces of equipment brought by one of the expedition members. With the help of the translator, the young woman spoke of her knowledge of the nearby islands and of her great desire to see more of the world."
 wwu_exploration.14.option.a: "Bring her with you and make an explorer out of her."
 wwu_exploration.14.option.b: "It is better for her to stay where she is."
 
 wwu_exploration.15.title: "Dead on Arrival"
 wwu_exploration.15.desc: "The life on board a ship is a lonesome one. In a few provinces the expeditions visited there were no shortage of willing arms to embrace and staunch the loneliness for a little while. Overly close contact with the natives may have caused the explorer's death, as he caught a strange disease which rapidly deteriorated his condition and led to heart failure. He was given a burial at sea, not far from $PROVINCENAME$."
 wwu_exploration.15.option.a: "Rest in peace."
