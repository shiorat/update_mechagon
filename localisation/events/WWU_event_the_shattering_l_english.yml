 cataclysm.4.title: "In The Void!"
 cataclysm.4.desc: "It's over.\n\nYou are dead. Death, despite what you expected, didn't bring peace, but more agony and pain.\n\nYet in the endless ocean of void and horror, you heard a voice. Nine Val'kyr, unbound from The Lich King's grasp, approached you and offered a pact. They offer freedom, life… and power over death..."

 cataclysm.5.title: "Power to Reanimate"

This might look like an evil act to those who don't understand the nature of undeath, yet we can't turn down this chance to use our new allies.\n\n... Where to find these dead bodies, is entirely up to us."

 cataclysm.6.desc: "The Kingdom of Gilneas no longer exists! The Gilnean lands are being ravaged by her enemies and rampaging feral worgens.\n\n Since they are a member of the Grand Alliance of Lordaeron, it is only natural to help her citizens in need. But immigrants often bring their problem with them and It might be not wise to open our gates to them completely."
 cataclysm.6.opt1: "Welcome all Gilneans to [Root.GetName] and your court"
 cataclysm.6.opt2: "Let Gilnean immigrants in"
 cataclysm.6.opt3: "No furries!"
