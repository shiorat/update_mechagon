 wwu_kel_thuzad.1.desc: "An ancient nerubian necropolis, Naxxramas was torn free from its ground in Northrend by agents of the Lich King to serve as Kel'Thuzad's floating base of operations.

 wwu_kel_thuzad.2.title: "Capture of Naxxramas"
 wwu_kel_thuzad.2.desc: "The malicious Kel'Thuzad once used Naxxramas as a base of operations. It appears that his phylactery has been stored within its corrupted halls as a means of protection. Unfortunately for him, the Scourge have faltered and Naxxramas is now ours. What shall we do with such an evil artifact?"

 wwu_kel_thuzad.3.desc: "The foolish acquisition of Kel'Thuzad's Phylactery by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has exposed the people of [Root.GetName] to scourge corruption. It appears the people of [target_province.GetName] have been corrupted."

 wwu_kel_thuzad.4.title: "Kel'Thuzad's Offer"
 wwu_kel_thuzad.4.desc: "A voice speaks to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], seemingly inviting them to reliquish control. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has the sense that acquiescing to the voice will grant great power, but with power comes sacrifice."

 wwu_kel_thuzad.5.option.b: "Resist!"
