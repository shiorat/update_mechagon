 sargeras_eye.1.title: "Illidan and the Eye of Sargeras"
 sargeras_eye.1.desc: "Illidan has fled the Broken Isles and the Tomb of Sargeras, where he has retrieved the powerful artifact Gul'dan never could - the Eye of Sargeras. Fleeing Maiev Shadowsong and her Wardens, Illidan sailed to the Eastern Kingdoms and marched to Dalaran. Under the instruction of his new Fel master, Kil'Jaeden, he begin a spell with the Eye that would tear Northrend apart. Kil'Jaeden hoped to get revenge on his disloyal servant Ner'Zhul and see the Frozen Throne upon which he sat destroyed. However, Illidan's powerful spell was intercepted and ended by the forces of Malfurion Stormrage and Maiev Shadowsong. The Lich King and Northrend have suffered from the spell's devastation - Ner'Zhul has started to lose control over the Scourge and His champion Arthas has begun losing his powers as well."
